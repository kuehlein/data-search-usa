# Data Search USA

This is a tool that utilizes the api provided by datausa.io to allow the user to build a customizable request for United States data, as well as browse said data.


## Step 1: Select a Table
>Choose from one of the many Tables that DataUSA lists as available. Unfortunately, sometimes these resources are not available. If that is the case, select a different table. This is all you really need to do before requesting the table. If you want, skip to Step 5.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 2: Filter the Table
>Limit the amount of rows in your table, or choose what level of data that you wish to display. Some of levels of data are not available, so you may need to select another if your request turns up empty.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 3: Select Columns
>Choose the columns that you wish to add to your table. All of the columns are used if you do not select any.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 4: Filter Columns
>Further refine your request by narrowing the scope of the data in a particular column. Do this with as many columns as you like, but doing so will shrink your response. If no table with these search parameters is available, try loosening or removing the offending column filters.

## Step 5: Click Go!
